# Taskman
A light-weight CLI based task manager built using Golang. Create the executable and add the path to rc file, and you can execute the command from anywhere inside a terminal.
For storing the data, a csv file will automatically be created during the installation phase inside the project hidden folder if you are on a mac or linux.
